# Simply-Dumb
## a All in One bot but it is made as "ONLY FUN" bot

### Note:
Dont try to do "copy paste" it. Do you know that making a bot is easier than managing the bot.. This Repo is public for **Educational Purpose Only**

### There are 60+ Commands.. 

Client/Client.js is the file which is for Command handler and for Dynamic Help..

index.js is the file which starts those files (./commands, ./events) and runs some things for repl.it thing..

events/message.js is the important file.. It gathers messages from guild (server) and it have soo many things like N word blocker, XP things for leveling, etc..

commands folder is where Commands for the bot is.

json.sqlite and eco.sqlite is nothing... Delete it.

## Note: You need .env File for start the bot because it contains Bot Token.. Found in Discord Application website.

### Please Dont be dumb like me and make the bot.
**And Thank you for seeing my repo**
